1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
<!--REACT uses a special syntax call JSX and it allows you to mix HTML and JavaScript.  This allows for faster and more efficient coding and makes building components much easier.  REACT creates its own Virtual DOM where the components live.  This give you flexibility and gains in performance.  REACT is also known to be more user friendly than writing with only javascript because you can run REACT on the server and DOM will be rendered and returned to the browser as a regular web page.-->
